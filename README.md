🧠 LangChain – Chat With Your Data



This project enables users to chat with their own data using natural language, powered by LangChain, LLMs, and vector search engines like FAISS or ChromaDB. Upload documents and ask questions to receive intelligent, context-aware answers.

🔍 Key Features
🔗 LangChain-powered document QA

📄 Supports PDF, CSV, and TXT files

🧠 Embedding-based vector search for semantic retrieval

💬 LLM-based responses (OpenAI, HuggingFace, etc.)

🖥️ Streamlit web UI (optional)

🌐 Local or API-based deployment

📦 Tech Stack
Python 3.10+

LangChain

FAISS or ChromaDB

OpenAI or any LLM backend

Streamlit (optional for UI)

[PyPDF2 / pandas / tiktoken / sentence-transformers]* depending on the file type support
